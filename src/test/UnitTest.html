<!--
* Runs a set of unit tests.
*
* When running uncompiled, the set is specified via <script> tags, which
* cause those unit test scripts to be loaded, so that their various functions
* are defined in the global scope.  The unit test functions have names starting
* with the word 'test' which allows them to be found by goog.testing.junit.
*
* The unit test is activated if one of the unit tests includes the line
*   goog.require('goog.testing.jsunit');
* which causes a function in jsunit to auto-execute (after all the scripts
* on the page have loaded).  That function looks for functions in the global scope
* whose name begins with 'test', and it then runs all those tests in alphabetic
* order, reporting the results by inserting elements into the webpage.
* You can also see the results in the console.
*
* NOTE: when adding a test, add it also in compile_test.sh.
*
* The compiled version of the unit tests is created by compile_test.sh which
* has a parallel list of unit test namespaces to run.  For example,
* including the namespace "myphysicslab.lab.util.Vector_test" will cause
* the contents of the file at src/lab/util/Vector_test.js to be compiled
* because that file includes the statement
*     goog.provide('myphysicslab.lab.util.Vector_test');
* Note that there is not any object created for that namespace.
* It is only a way to trick the compiler into compiling that particular file,
* which results in various test functions, such as 'testVector', being added
* to the global scope so that goog.testing.jsunit can find them, similar to
* the uncompiled method.
*
* Unit tests need to use goog.exportProperty to ensure the name
* of the unit test functions are not minified, so that goog.testing.jsunit
* can find them by looking for functions that begin with 'test'.
